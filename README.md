Persistence:

I used Realm in saving data. I choose Realm because it is easy to use, it saves and and query data faster. The implementation also is very straight forward. It has his own Realm Studio to view and manage data.

Architecture:
q
I used MVVM as a architecture pattern. MVVM offers a way to organize code that doesnâ€™t result in massive view controllers. MVVM is agile which is good in moving out a new feature. It is also good for Testability because your external and internal dependences are separated. The only disadvantage of MVVM is that when handling bigger cases, it is hard to design the ViewModel. Sometimes debugging is hard also because of complex data bindings.
